### optimism  

Optimism block production is primarily managed by a single party, called the "sequencer," which helps the network by providing the following services:  

+ Providing instant transaction confirmations and state updates 
+ Constructing and executing L2 blocks
+ Submitting user transactions to L1  

Optimism nodes are made up of two primary components, the Ethereum data indexer and the Optimism client software.
